                    <h3>Masks and the Policing of Health</h3>
                    <p> During the COVID-19 pandemic I was writing my dissertation on the New York City jails and kept
                        finding parallels between my carceral research and the debates about masking and its enforcement
                        in the United States. Carceral imaginaries and logics are visible across the pandemic, as calls
                        for people to wear masks were often read as dichotomic issues of compliance/autonomy,
                        discipline/freedom, and control/resistance. These binaries stood in contrast to notions of
                        collectivism, care, and relationalities. Carceral themes were similarly evident in state
                        responses to non-compliance with mask regulations, as law enforcement officers served as the
                        executors of public health regulations. This led me down a path of historical research to better
                        understand the history of masking and its enforcement during prior pandemics. In total, this
                        research has resulted in nine publications, one of which directly connected to my research as it
                        addressed the punitive use of masks in prisons and jails, and the implications of carceral
                        paradigms in the context of global health crises. </p>
